# Stock Wave Analyzer - C++ CLR Implementation

A technical analysis application for stock market visualization built with C++ CLR and Windows Forms. Features automated pattern recognition, wave detection, and Fibonacci analysis with candlestick chart rendering.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Candlestick Chart Visualization**: OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick rendering with managed chart controls
- **Peak & Valley Detection**: Automated identification with text annotations (P for peaks, V for valleys)
- **Wave Pattern Recognition**: Visual wave overlays connecting alternating peaks and valleys
- **Fibonacci Retracement Lines**: Technical analysis for support and resistance level identification
- **Multi-File CSV Support**: Load and display multiple stock data files in dropdown selection
- **Simulation Mode**: Animated historical data playback with configurable speed and step controls

### Technical Implementation
- C++/CLI managed code with native performance optimization
- Windows Forms UI with custom chart annotation system
- Point-based positioning for precise annotation alignment
- Dynamic data filtering and pattern recognition algorithms

## Technologies Used

- **C++/CLI**: Mixed-mode programming combining native C++ with .NET Framework
- **Windows Forms**: GUI framework for desktop application
